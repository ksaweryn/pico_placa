# pico_placa
StackBuilder question

I am trying to:

Using object-oriented, tested code using the language that you feel most proficient in, please write a "pico y placa" predictor. The inputs should be a license plate number (the full 
number, not the last digit), a date (as a String), and a time, and the program will return whether or not that car can be on the road.

Branch for testing

To run the program please use jdk 8, then open your terminal/cmd and execute:

java -jar pico-placa-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <vehicleLicense> <date> <time>
  
Please replace the input args as requiered.
